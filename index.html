<p style ="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 
  I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, currently Undecided Business, but I plan to major in Accounting while also on the pre-med track. I grew up in Richmond, TX (a small city within Houston) with my parents and three siblings (Nathaniel, Daniel, and Samuel), all names that rhyme except for my own. Hopefully, there will be an addition to our family, when we get a dog I have been begging my parents for since I was little. Neverthesless, I love my family, friends, and God. </p>
  
<p style ="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 
  I can usually be found at a coffeeshop, somewhere outside on campus, or, from time-to-time, running around in Disney World. My favorite foods include Pirate's Booty (it's good, trust me) and pasta, and I could probably survive on cold brew coffee. The way to my heart is a classic chocolate milkshake or a random trip to Target!  </p>
